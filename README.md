# 👋 Hi, I'm Malin!

I'm a web development student with a background in social work. After several years of supporting people in vulnerable life situations, I decided to combine my interest in technology with my passion for accessibility and problem-solving — and make the switch to tech.

💻 I'm currently studying full-stack development with a focus on:

	•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, TypeScript, Next.js
	•	Backend: PHP, Laravel, SQL, C#
	•	CMS & Tools: WordPress
	•	Other: Git & GitHub, accessibility (a11y)

My goal is to build thoughtful, inclusive digital tools — especially for users with cognitive or executive functioning challenges. You can see an example of this in my project [ToDoHelper](https://github.com/PU-MEriksson/ToDoHelper), which uses AI to break down tasks into manageable steps, and [Momentum](https://github.com/PU-MEriksson/anti-procrastinator) - a web app that helps people get started on tasks they find difficult.

🌱 Right now, I'm looking for a LIA (internship) during november 2025 - may 2026, where I can continue growing as a developer and contribute to meaningful products.

Feel free to check out my pinned projects or reach out!
