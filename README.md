# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Malin!

I'm a web development student with a background in social work. After several years of supporting people in vulnerable life situations, I decided to combine my interest in technology with my passion for accessibility and problem-solving â€” and make the switch to tech.

ðŸ’» I'm currently studying full-stack development with a focus on:

	â€¢	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, TypeScript, Next.js
	â€¢	Backend: PHP, Laravel, SQL, C#
	â€¢	CMS & Tools: WordPress, Sanity
	â€¢	Other: Git & GitHub, accessibility (a11y)

My goal is to build thoughtful, inclusive digital tools â€” especially for users with cognitive or executive functioning challenges. You can see an example of this in my project [ToDoHelper](https://github.com/PU-MEriksson/ToDoHelper), which uses AI to break down tasks into manageable steps.

ðŸŒ± Right now, I'm looking for a LIA (internship) where I can continue growing as a developer and contribute to meaningful products.

Feel free to check out my pinned projects or reach out!
